# About the node-alexa-smapi test suite
This test suite will perform the following actions:
- Retrieve a valid access_token and keep it for use in all SMAPI invocations.
- List all vendors and use the first vendor (account) in the list to create a test skill.
- Invoke all SMAPI operations against this test skill.
- Remove the test skill after all SMAPI testing is complete.
- If a test run fails, you may need to manually clean up the test skill created during the failed test run.

# About the test skill created by this test suite
By default the test skill created will have:
- Name: SMAPI test skill
- Logo: a bug over a blue background [see it here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/node-alexa-smapi/icons/icon_512_A2Z.png).
- These default values may be changed by changing the manifest files under test/data

# node-alexa-smapi test suite requirements
Please follow the steps below in order to successfully run this test suite:
- First obtain refreshToken, clientId, and clientSecret
  - Follow [these instructions](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-command-reference.html#util-command) to retrieve clientId and clientSecret.
  - Run `ask util generate-lwa-tokens` to generate a refreshToken (copy the value from refresh_token and use it to initialize refreshToken in the next step).
- Then create and populate the file test/data/secrets.json with the following information:
  - refreshToken (starts with "Atzr|")
  - clientId
  - clientSecret

Sample test/data/secrets.json:
```
{
	"refreshToken": "generated by ask util generate-lwa-tokens",
	"clientId": "amzn1.application-oa2-client.myClientId",
	"clientSecret": "myClientSecret"
}

```

# Configuration options
Due to the asynchronous nature of this test suite, you may need to adjust one of the following configuration parameters so the test suite complete successfully.

```javascript
const LOG_RESPONSES = false; // if true will output (console.log) the response received by each SMAPI operation
const MAX_RETRIES = 10; // number of times the test suite will check for completion of create/update operations before proceeding with other test cases
const RETRY_TIMEOUT = 10000; // time (in milliseconds) to wait before checking again for completion of create/update operations
const MOCHA_TIMEOUT = 10000; // for details see https://mochajs.org/#timeouts
```
